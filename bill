#program name- Big Bazaar specifies its customers into three categories as Bronze, Silver and Gold. If the
#shopping amount is greater than 25000, the category is GOLD. If the shopping amount is
#between 10000 and 25000, the category is SILVER, otherwise the category is BRONZE. The
#discount offered for GOLD customers is 20% of the shopping amount, for SILVER customers is
#10% of the shopping amount and 5% otherwise. Design a program in python that asks the user
#to input the total shopping amount, outputs the category and amount to be paid.

a=eval(input ("enter the amount"))
if(a>25000):
	print("your categorie is GOLD")
